## About The Project

A portfolio website built for a client to showcase their work across film, writing, and sketch mediums. Includes multiple pages dedicated to specific projects as well as multiple galleries and ways to display content. Challenges included finding a color sceheme that matched the clients quirky style and finding a way to condense their current website into a more manageable amount of pages. The page itself had to be fast and responsive--as all sites should be--but with the added complexity of a large amount of photos and video.

  Dynamic header video with navigation that works alongside it. The client, being an actor and filmmaker, had a lot of fun footage that really showcased their personality. We wanted their personality to be featured by a spotlight--the first thing you see when you visit their set. I cut this video together for them and styled it so it worked with the color scheme they wanted. Additional features included building in a "poster" image so, on browsers that don't allow autoplay, it just shows a more normal image header.
